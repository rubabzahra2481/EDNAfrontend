## Scoring Implementation

Layer 2 scoring uses the **40% threshold + 12% gap** rule:
- A subtype is considered **dominant** if it scores ≥40% AND has a gap of ≥12% from the second-highest subtype
- Otherwise, the profile is considered **balanced** within that core type

**Files:**
- `/lib/layer1-core-identity.ts` - Core type calculation (Architect/Alchemist/Blurred)
- `/lib/scoring-engine.ts` - Subtype calculation with 40%/12% threshold
