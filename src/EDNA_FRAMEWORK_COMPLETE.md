# EDNA Framework - Complete 7-Layer Specification

## Overview

The EDNA (Entrepreneurial DNA) framework is a comprehensive 7-layer profiling system that maps cognitive, behavioral, and values patterns to create deeply personalized learning and mentorship experiences.

---

## Layer 1 — Core Identity (Architect | Alchemist | Blurred)

### Purpose
Identify the user's **natural cognitive loop**: the default sequencing of logic and emotion when perceiving, deciding, and acting.

### Key Concepts

#### **Cognitive Loops**
- **Architect**: `logic → emotion → logic`
  - Starts with facts, models, constraints
  - Emotions are consulted after initial rational frame
  - "System first. Meaning emerges after the system makes sense."

- **Alchemist**: `emotion → logic → emotion`
  - Starts with felt sense, narrative, gestalt
  - Logic formalizes what intuition already sees
  - "Energy first. The story must feel right before the math aligns."

- **Blurred**: Initiative loop that masks the natural one
  - Adaptive loop that mirrors context
  - Natural loop is obscured
  - "Highly adaptive, EDNA will stabilize your natural loop, then tailor delivery."

### 5 Construct Signals

1. **Input Primacy**
   - Architect: Starts with facts, models, constraints
   - Alchemist: Starts with felt sense, narrative, gestalt

2. **Validation Source**
   - Architect: "It's true because it computes" (logical consistency, proof, repeatability)
   - Alchemist: "It's right because it resonates" (meaning coherence, narrative fit, alignment)

3. **Decision Loop**
   - Architect: `model → test → adjust` (emotions modulate but don't steer)
   - Alchemist: `sense → frame → express` (logic sharpens but feeling steers)

4. **Time Horizon**
   - Architect: Medium-to-long with staged checkpoints
   - Alchemist: Long arc vision with leaping moments and narrative milestones

5. **Error Pattern Under Stress**
   - Architect: Analysis lock, model rigidity, dismissal of soft signals
   - Alchemist: Over-index on vibes, story jumps, under-specification

### EDNA Adaptations

**Architect Sprint Style**: `Plan → Do → Check → Act`, with explicit kill-scale gates
- Default artifacts: SOPs, Checklists, Dashboards, Pre-mortems, Decision trees
- Coach prompts: "Which model would change your mind?" "Which assumption dominates variance?"

**Alchemist Sprint Style**: `Sense → Test → Show`, then consolidation blocks to codify what worked
- Default artifacts: Narrative briefs, Hypotheses canvases, Vision ladders, Demo-first loops
- Coach prompts: "What must be true?" "Which 2 constraints matter now?" "How will we know it worked?"

**Blurred Sprint Style**: Two-track approach
- One Architect stack (spec + checkpoint)
- One Alchemist track (vision + demo)
- Track energy, output quality, and friction to infer natural loop

### Scoring
- **6-8 items per bucket**
- Weight Input Primacy and Validation highest (×1.5)
- **Architect score** = sum of A-leaning responses (weighted)
- **Alchemist score** = sum of B-leaning responses (weighted)
- **Stability Index** = |Architect − Alchemist| / total
  - High stability with high variance across contexts → candidate **Blurred**

### Classification Rules
- If `Architect − Alchemist ≥ threshold` → **Architect**
- If `Alchemist − Architect ≥ threshold` → **Alchemist**
- If difference < threshold for two or more contexts AND stress pattern flips across contexts → **Blurred**

## Layer 3 — Mirror Pair Awareness (Opposite Validator Integration)

### Purpose
Measure how well the user **accesses their opposite validator** (Architect ↔ Alchemist).

### 5 Dimensions (0-100 scoring)

1. **Recognition (R)**: Can you identify when the opposite validator matters?
2. **Translation (T)** ×1.25: Can you convert insights across validators?
3. **Integration (I)**: Can you run both loops simultaneously or in rapid succession?
4. **Governance (G)** ×1.25: Do you have rituals to ensure both validators are consulted?
5. **Conflict Recovery (C)**: When validators conflict, can you resolve or hold the tension?

### Overall Score Formula
```
Overall = ((R + T×1.25 + I + G×1.25 + C) / 5.5) × 100
```

### Score Bands
- **85-100**: Mastery
- **75-84**: High
- **65-74**: Moderate
- **50-64**: Low
- **0-49**: Very Low

### Practical Scenarios

**Scenario 1 – Launch Deadline, Weak Adoption**
- Architect default: adds specs/tests → misses narrative gap
- Alchemist default: amplifies story → risks SLO breach
- High awareness: runs demo review → extracts must-be-true → builds constraints → feasible cut

**Scenario 2 – Viral Buzz, Ops Strain**
- Architect default: runs demo review → extracts requirements
- Alchemist default: adds capacity model + timelines
- High awareness: capacity planning with narrative preservation

### QA Checklist
- ✅ Directional scores (A→L, L→A) included
- ✅ Sub-scale scores (R, T, I, G, C) included
- ✅ Dual-KPI and chairing roles present
- ✅ For Blurred: both directions evaluated + Layer 1 stabilization linked

## Layer 4 — Learning Style Preferences

### Purpose
Measures **how you absorb, process, and apply new information**. Unlike Layer 1 (your cognitive loop), this is about **what you think** but **how you learn best**.

### Capability Model (5 Domains)

1. **Modality Preference**: How information enters (sight, sound, text, movement)
   - Visual, Auditory, Read-Write, Kinesthetic, Multimodal

2. **Approach**: How information is sequenced (linear vs. exploratory)
   - Structured, Global/Exploratory, Adaptive

3. **Concept Processing**: How information is framed (facts vs. patterns)
   - Concrete, Abstract, Flexible

4. **Immersion**: Solo vs. group
   - Individual, Collaborative, Adaptive

5. **Pace**: How information flows (bursts vs. steady)
   - Fast, Slow, Versatile

### Does NOT Measure
- ❌ Cognitive loop identity (L1)
- ❌ Scope focus area (L2)
- ❌ Opposite integration (L3)
- ❌ Accessibility needs like ADHD/dyslexia/autism (L5)
- ❌ Risk tolerance or extraversion (L6)
- ❌ Value beliefs (L7)

### Subscales

#### 1. Modality Preference
- Options: Visual, Auditory, Read-Write, Kinesthetic, Multimodal
- Sprint style: 
  - Visual → **Sense** → Test → Show
  - Auditory → Sense → **Test** → Show
  - Kinesthetic → Sense → Test → **Show**

#### Result Templates by Type

**Architect Result**:
> "You are an Architect: you default to structured reasoning, validate through models, and refine with feedback."

**Alchemist Result**:
> "You are an Alchemist: you default to vision and pattern, formalize with logic, and move when it resonates."

**Blurred Result**:
> "You present as Blurred: highly adaptive, EDNA will stabilize your natural loop, then tailor delivery."

## Layer 5 — Neurodiversity & Accessibility

### Purpose
Map **neurocognitive variance** and **focus regulation** to adapt the platform experience.

### Capability Model (4 Domains)

1. **Modality Preference**: How information enters (sight, sound, text, movement)
2. **Approach**: How information is sequenced (linear vs. exploratory)
3. **Concept Processing**: How information is framed (facts vs. patterns)
4. **Pace**: How information flows (bursts vs. steady)

Each learner has a profile across all five.

### Domain Scoring (0-100)

1. **Attention & Regulation**: How focus is initiated, maintained, and transitioned
2. **Language & Processing**: Ease and mode of understanding symbols, text, or speech
3. **Concept Processing**: How information is framed (facts vs. patterns)
4. **Sensory Input Management**: How the brain filters or prioritizes sensory input

### Pattern Detection
- **ADHD-linked rhythms**: Variable focus, novelty seeking, hyper-stimulation preference
- **Dyslexia indicators**: Difficulty decoding text, visual-spatial dominance
- **Autism-linked cognition**: Need for predictability, stability, explicit rules
- **Sensory sensitivity**: High responsiveness to sound, light, movement
- **Compound profiles**: e.g., ADHD + Dyslexia

### EDNA Tuning
- Multi-modal delivery (text summaries, video diagrams, audio explanations)
- Customization knobs (highlight tools, templates, pacing extensions)
- Environment settings (solo reflection tools, group discussion prompts)
- Pacing controls (sprint-style vs extended deep-dive modes)

### Clean Boundaries (What L5 Does NOT Measure)
- ❌ No learning modality or pace language (→ L4)
- ❌ No neurodiversity trait language (→ L5)
- ❌ No risk/extraversion framing (→ L6)
- ❌ No value/belief language (→ L7)

## Layer 7 — Meta-Beliefs & Values

### Purpose
Deep-level worldview and orientation toward growth, purpose, innovation, metrics, collaboration, and resource availability.

### 6 Value Axes (0-100 scoring)

1. **Growth Philosophy**: Craftsmanship (0) ← → Bold Scaling (100)
2. **Purpose Filter**: Profit-Focused (0) ← → Mission-Driven (100)
