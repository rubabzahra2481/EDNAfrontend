## Layer 3 Question Flow

**Purpose:** Test how someone responds when they observe behavior from their opposite type.

**Conditional Display:**
- **If Layer 1 = Architect** → Show Architect Layer 3 questions (opposite = Alchemist)
- **If Layer 1 = Alchemist** → Show Alchemist Layer 3 questions (opposite = Architect)  
- **If Layer 1 = Blurred** → Show Blurred Layer 3 questions (opposite = clear single-type)

## Scoring Implementation

Layer 3 scoring calculates **Mirror Awareness (MA)** using the formula:

```
Mirror Score = (Opposite Type Points) / (Total Responses)
```

**Classification:**
- **High MA (≥60%)**: "Integrated" - Can see and appreciate opposite type
- **Medium MA (40-59%)**: "Aware" - Acknowledges opposite but doesn't fully integrate
- **Low MA (<40%)**: "Resistant" - Struggles to appreciate opposite type

**Files:**
- `/lib/layer3-mirror-awareness.ts` - Mirror awareness calculation
- `/lib/scoring-engine.ts` - Main scoring engine that calls Layer 3 scoring
