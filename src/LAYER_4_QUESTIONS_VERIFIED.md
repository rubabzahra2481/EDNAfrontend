## Scoring Implementation

Layer 4 scoring aggregates responses across all dimensions to create a **Learning Style Profile**:

### Key Dimensions:
1. **Modality Preference** (VARK Model):
   - Visual
   - Auditory
   - Read/Write
   - Kinesthetic
   - Multimodal

2. **Learning Approach**:
   - Sequential/Structured (step-by-step)
   - Global/Exploratory (big picture first)

3. **Concept Processing**:
   - Concrete/Sensing (real examples)
   - Abstract/Intuitive (theories, concepts)

4. **Social Preference**:
   - Individual (solo work)
   - Collaborative (team work)
   - Guided (mentoring)

5. **Learning Pace**:
   - Fast (intensive, rapid)
   - Slow (steady, thorough)

### Output:
The Layer 4 profile is used to **personalize LMS content delivery**, including:
- Content format (videos vs text vs interactive)
- Lesson structure (sequential vs exploratory)
- Assignment types (individual vs collaborative)
- Pacing recommendations (intensive vs steady)

---

## Implementation Files

- **`/lib/layer4-7-questions.ts`** - All Layer 4 questions stored and verified ✅
- **Question IDs:** L4_Q19 through L4_Q28 (10 questions)

---

## Integration with Scoring Engine

**File:** `/lib/scoring-engine.ts`

Layer 4 results are calculated and included in the final EDNA profile as:
```typescript
{
  learning_style: {
    modality: 'multimodal',
    approach: 'sequential',
    concept_processing: 'concrete',
    social_preference: 'individual',
    pace: 'slow'
  }
}
```

This profile is then used by:
- **PersonalizedLMS** component to customize course delivery
- **AI Chat** to adapt communication style
- **Course recommendations** to match learning preferences

---

## Question Design Patterns

### Reinforcement Strategy
- **Q19 and Q24** are intentional duplicates to validate modality preference
- Multiple questions per dimension ensure accurate profiling

### Option Tagging
Each option is tagged with specific learning style indicators:
- **Sequential**: Structured, step-by-step, planned
- **Global**: Big picture, exploratory, flexible
- **Concrete**: Real examples, hands-on, practical
- **Abstract**: Theories, concepts, ideas
- **Individual**: Solo, self-paced, independent
- **Collaborative**: Team, group, shared
- **Fast**: Quick, intensive, rapid
- **Slow**: Steady, thorough, careful
