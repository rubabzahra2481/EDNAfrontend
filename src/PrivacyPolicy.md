Brandscaling iOS App Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 3 February 2026 
Last Updated: 3 February 2026

1. Introduction
Brandscaling is an AI-powered Decision Intelligence and Collaboration Mastery ecosystem
designed to help you understand how you think, feel, and make decisions — so you can
operate with clarity, consistency, and stability under real business pressure.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal
information when you use the Brandscaling iOS application (the “App”).
For the purposes of UK GDPR, Brand Scaling Ltd. is the data controller of the information
processed through the App.

2. Information We Collect
2.1 Information You Provide Directly
We may collect information you provide when you:
• Create an account
• Take the E-DNA Assessment
• Complete interactive workbooks
• Engage with AI mentors
• Contact support
This may include:
• Name
• Email address
• Entrepreneurial Decision Network Assessment (E-DNA) responses
• Workbook decision entries
• Identifiers related to your Apple ID for purchase validation
2.2 E-DNA Decision Intelligence Data
Brandscaling’s core service includes generating your personalised E-DNA decision profile.
This profile reflects aspects of how you form, validate, and execute decisions, including
indicators related to decision-making style, learning preferences, and stability under
entrepreneurial pressure.

Your E-DNA profile is used solely to personalise your experience inside the App, including
learning pathways, interactive tools, and AI mentor guidance.
Important Boundary: E-DNA is not a medical, psychological, or clinical diagnosis. It is a
decision intelligence framework designed for entrepreneurial development and support.
2.3 Information Collected Automatically
When you use the App, we may collect:
• Device type and operating system
• App interaction data (e.g., feature usage, session duration)
• Usage analytics
• Crash reports and performance diagnostics
This data is used to improve app reliability, security, and user experience.

3. Payments (Apple In-App Purchases)
All paid features, subscriptions, and upgrades in the Brandscaling iOS App are processed
securely through Apple’s In-App Purchase system. Brandscaling does not collect or store
your full payment card details. Apple handles payment processing according to its own
privacy and security policies.

4. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
• Provide personalised E-DNA results and reports
• Adapt learning pathways and workbook pacing
• Enable AI mentor guidance aligned to your decision loop
• Track progress and completion signals
• Maintain platform security and performance
• Improve the App’s stability and functionality

5. Legal Bases for Processing (UK GDPR)
We process personal data only where a valid legal basis applies, including:
• Performance of a Contract: To provide account access, E-DNA profile generation,
personalised learning, and AI mentorship.
• Legitimate Interests: To monitor app performance, ensure security, prevent misuse,
and improve services without overriding user rights.
• Consent: Where required, including for direct marketing communications.
• Legal Obligation: Where processing is necessary to comply with applicable laws.

For clarity: account data and E-DNA processing rely primarily on performance of a contract;
analytics and diagnostics rely on legitimate interests; marketing communications rely on
consent.

6. AI Mentors and Automated Processing
Brandscaling includes two AI mentors: AI-Architect and AI-Alchemist. These mentors may
process your E-DNA profile and learning context to provide personalised guidance. AI
mentors:
• Do not make decisions for you
• Do not provide medical, legal, or financial advice
• Do not replace human judgement
Brandscaling does not engage in solely automated decision-making that produces legal or
similarly significant effects as defined under Article 22 of the UK GDPR.

7. Data Storage and Deletion
Your E-DNA profile is persistent and versioned over time. Workbook outputs are stored as
structured decision artifacts to support continuity and reflection.
We retain your personal data for as long as your account remains active. If you delete your
account, your personal data will be permanently deleted within 30 days, except where
retention is required for legal or accounting purposes. Anonymised data may be retained
indefinitely for analytical and improvement purposes.

8. Sharing of Data
We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with trusted service providers
only for:
• Hosting and infrastructure (e.g., AWS)
• Analytics and app performance monitoring (e.g., Firebase)
• AI service delivery (e.g., OpenAI)
All service providers are required to maintain appropriate confidentiality and security
safeguards. Some providers may be located outside the UK. Where international transfers
occur, we ensure appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses are in place.

9. Your Rights (UK GDPR)
You have the right to:

• Access your personal data
• Correct inaccurate data
• Request deletion of your data
• Restrict or object to certain processing
• Request a copy of your data in a portable, machine-readable format (data portability)
• Withdraw consent for marketing at any time
• Lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at
ico.org.uk if you believe your data protection rights have been violated.
To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below.

10. Security
We implement appropriate technical and organisational safeguards including:
• Encryption in transit and at rest
• Access controls and principle of least privilege
• Regular monitoring for unauthorised access
In the event of a personal data breach, we will notify affected users and the ICO where
required by law.

11. Tracking Technologies &amp; Cookies
The Brandscaling App does not use cookies or other similar technologies for tracking users
across third-party apps or websites for advertising purposes. Our use of analytics tools is
confined to improving the app experience itself. We do not use any trackers that would
require consent under Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.

12. Children’s Privacy
The Brandscaling App is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not
knowingly collect personal data from children.

13. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as the ecosystem evolves. Material changes will be
communicated in-app or via email.
