          <ul>
            <li>To create and manage your account.</li>

            <li>To communicate with you about your account or updates to our services.</li>
          </ul>
        </PolicySection>

        <PolicySection title="5. Third-Party AI Processing">
          <p>
            To provide our Decision Intelligence Agent features, we use services from trusted third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek). This section explicitly details the data shared with these services.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-3">5.1 What Data Is Sent to Third Parties?</h3>
          <p>
            When you interact with the Decision Intelligence Agent, we send a limited, session-scoped set of your data to our AI partners to generate a relevant response. <strong>We never share your name, email, or other direct personal identifiers with these partners.</strong> The specific data transmitted is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your E-DNA Profile Summary:</strong> A high-level summary of your E-DNA type (e.g., &quot;Architect, Alchemist&quot;).</li>
            <li><strong>Your Current Query:</strong> The specific question or prompt you just entered into the chat.</li>
            <li><strong>Recent Conversation History:</strong> The immediate preceding turns of your conversation with the AI agent to provide context.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Who Receives This Data?</h3>
          <p>
            Your data may be sent to one or more of the following trusted service providers, depending on the AI model you select within the App, for the sole purpose of delivering the AI Agent service:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI, L.L.C.</strong> (San Francisco, USA)</li>
            <li><strong>Anthropic, PBC</strong> (San Francisco, USA)</li>
            <li><strong>Google, LLC (for Gemini)</strong> (Mountain View, USA)</li>
            <li><strong>DeepSeek, Ltd.</strong> (Hangzhou, China)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5.3 Your Permission — Explicit Consent Before Data Is Shared</h3>
          <p>
            In compliance with Apple&apos;s guidelines, <strong>we will not transmit any of your data to a third-party AI service without your explicit permission.</strong> This applies to both registered and guest users.
          </p>
          <p>Before you can use the AI agent&apos;s features for the first time, the App will present a clear, one-time consent screen. This screen will:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>State that the feature uses third-party AI services to function.</li>
            <li>Clearly list the specific data that will be shared (as detailed in Section 5.1).</li>
            <li>Name the third parties who may receive the data (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek).</li>
            <li>Require you to actively tap a button to provide your consent before proceeding.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you do not consent, the rest of the App remains fully functional, but the AI agent&apos;s features will be disabled.</p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5.4 Withdrawing Consent</h3>
          <p>
            If you have previously granted consent and wish to withdraw it, you can do so at any time. Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; AI Agent Data</strong> and select <strong>&quot;Withdraw Consent.&quot;</strong> This will immediately disable all AI agent data transmission and deactivate the AI agent features until consent is re-granted.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5.5 Equal Protection Commitment</h3>
          <p>
            All our third-party AI service providers are contractually bound by Data Processing Agreements (DPAs). These agreements ensure they provide the same or equal protection of your data as stated in this Privacy Policy. They may not use data transmitted from the Brandscaling App for their own advertising, marketing, or to train their models. All international data transfers are governed by Standard Contractual Clauses approved under UK GDPR.

        <PolicySection title="7. Guest Users and Data Collection">
          <p>
            If you use features of the App that are available without creating an account (such as the guest-accessible AI chat), we will not collect any personal data from you. As noted in Section 5.3, we will still ask for your explicit consent before transmitting any chat data to our third-party AI partners. Any interaction with the AI Agent in a guest mode will be processed anonymously and will not be linked to any device or user identifier.

        </PolicySection>

        <PolicySection title="8. Future Features (Phase 2)">
          <p>
            Brandscaling is an evolving ecosystem. Future versions of the App may include additional features that require new data processing, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Social Logins (Apple, Google):</strong> To provide alternative ways to create an account.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Collaboration Features:</strong> To allow you to share insights or workbooks with team members within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced AI Capabilities:</strong> Including features that may process additional data types (such as workbook content) to provide deeper, more personalised insights. For example, we may use a vector database (e.g., from Pinecone Systems, Inc.) to allow the AI to find relevant information from your past work without sending the raw text for every query.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Before any such features are enabled, this Privacy Policy will be updated, and we will obtain your explicit consent for any new data sharing where required.
          </p>
        </PolicySection>

        <PolicySection title="9. Legal Bases for Processing (UK GDPR)">
          <p>We process personal data only where a valid legal basis applies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> To provide account access, E-DNA profile generation, and workbook functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> To monitor app performance, ensure security, and improve services.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For all AI agent data processing involving transmission to third parties.</li>

        <PolicySection title="10. Data Storage, Retention, and Deletion">
          <p>
            We retain your personal data for as long as your account remains active. If you delete your account, your personal data will be permanently deleted within 30 days, except where retention is required for legal or accounting purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>In-App Account Deletion:</strong> You can permanently delete your Brandscaling account and all associated personal data directly from within the App at any time. To do so, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Delete Account</strong>. You will be asked to confirm your decision before deletion is initiated. This action is irreversible.

        <PolicySection title="12. Security">
          <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organisational safeguards, including encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256), access controls, and regular monitoring for unauthorised access.

          <p>
